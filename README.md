# COVID19 Confirmed Cases Analysis
In this project, I analyzed the COVID19 dataset(updated from John Hopkins University) and comped with the happiness world dataset.
There are three different datasets in this repository based on coronavirus: confirmed, death and recovered cases, which I chose confirmed cases for the first analysis.

Results show that developed countries are more prone to getting the infection!


My main focus was in Canada but all countries are available in the dataset for analyzing.
All datasets are available in this repository.
The analysis is written in python Jupiter notebook.
