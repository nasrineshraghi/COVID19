# COVID19
In this project, I analyzed the COVID19 dataset(updated from John Hopkins University) and comped with the happiness world dataset.

Results show that developed countriesare more prone to getting the infection!


My main focus was in Canada but all counries are available in dataset for analysing.
All dataset are available in this repository.
The analysis is written in python Jupiter notebook.
